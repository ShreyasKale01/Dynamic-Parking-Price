# Dynamic Parking Price Project 🚗📈

This project implements a **data-driven dynamic pricing model** for urban parking lots.  
The goal is to optimize parking prices based on real-time demand patterns to improve space utilization and revenue.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Urban parking lots often face:
- Overcrowding during peak hours  
- Underutilization during off-peak hours  
- Fixed pricing that doesn’t reflect real demand  

This project solves the problem using **dynamic pricing**, where prices change based on demand factors.

---

## 🧠 Approach

The pricing model considers:

- Time of day  
- Parking demand  
- Occupancy trends  
- Historical patterns  

Prices increase during high demand and decrease during low demand to balance usage.
